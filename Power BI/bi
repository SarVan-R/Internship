Objective of analysis:
This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), a transformative government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed
wage employment opportunities. The dataset used for this analysis encompasses a wide range of parameters, including the number of job cards issued, the workforce engaged, budget allocation, work
completion statistics, and much more. Through the application of data analytics techniques, we aim to gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts
in India.

Problem Statement:
NREGA is a vital initiative to alleviate rural unemployment and poverty. This project seeks to address several key questions and challenges associated with NREGA:
● How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
● Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
● What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with
employment generation?
● What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there
any roadblocks to its success?
● Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the
scheme's impact?
